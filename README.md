# IMAZE

This is a repository which contains details of the *imaze* project.


TASK

Design a controller for an Autonomous robot that can navigate through the maze. The Bot should have the ability to avoid any
kind of collision with the walls. To help you accomplish this task, you are given distance measuring sensors which can be
used to make your bot move.

DETAILS

The Bot should be fully autonomous.The Bot will start from the end of the maze and should spiral into its center.
There will be 4 distance sensors. Two in front, one at the left and one at the right. They will give the value of the 
distance of the wall in the specified direction they are at.The Bot should detect the walls and gaps using the distance
sensors and move through the gaps to complete the Maze.

BOT SPECIFICATIONS

E-puck
* BOT (Bot width =7.4 cm)
* we are using the robot, E-puck. It is a miniature two wheeled mobile robot originally developed at EPFL for teaching
  purposes.
* It has one forehead camera.
* It has 7 distance sensors of which you will be using only 4.
* There will be some set of functions to access the sensor values and control the wheels.
